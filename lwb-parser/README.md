# LWB parser

A standalone version of the parser of rust-lwb. Rust-lwb is actually
not released yet on its own (and may never be) but the parser is quite useful already

This is a project inspired by the TU Delft programming languages group's project called
[spoofax](https://www.spoofax.dev/). 

The parser will read a definition of your syntax, and generate an AST
plus the code to fill the AST from strings for you.

You can find documentation for it [here](https://jonay2000.github.io/rust-lwb/)
